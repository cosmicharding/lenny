- [ ] 9. Figure out why image exports are turning black after first export in parallaxer



	4 unify alignment and interlace sketches
	√1 make alignment crop at full size
	3 add in 2.5D option for multiple layers of parallax alignment
	2 render farthest left and right frames in red-blue anaglyph for screen viewing
	6 depth map?
	5 add in entry fields for variables / lenticular types / files
	√change sketch to load all images and just draw the ones based on offset and adjust
		make offset & adjust user-controlled
	find relationship between anaglyph preview disparity in stereo pairs and lenticular 
	fix image export in click event (goes out of bounds)
